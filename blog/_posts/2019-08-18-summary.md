The GSoC coding period is coming to an end and it is time to reflect upon what all has been achieved, what could'nt be done and what can be done more in future. My project was aimed at enriching the model zoo of `Flux.jl` by making additions in the form of gans, reinforcement learning agents and an image-captioning network. Precisely the following models have been implemented as a part of the coding period : 

1. CycleGAN
2. pix2pix
3. SRGAN
4. Proximal Policy Optimization
5. Trust Region Policy Optimization
6. Deep Recurrent Q Learning
7. Neural Image Captioning

These were exactly the part of the proposal as well. Let's go one by one over explaining the work, analysing what has been achieved and what was lacking in each period.

## The Generative Adversarial Networks

Clubbed under these are the models `Cyclegan`, `pix2pix` and `Super-Resolution-GAN`. These have been added to model-zoo in the following PR : [#157](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/pull/157)

`Cyclegan` and `pix2pix` are multi-modal image-to-image translation networks. `pix2pix` learns the translation in one direction at a time during training and works with paired labels. Some cool instances of it's working are colorising sketches or generating buildings from segmentation maps. `Cyclegan` learns a combined translation between both the domains during training. The improvement aided here is that it does not need any paired labels. `pix2pix` has a generator and a discriminator and apart from normal adversarial loss, works with a `L1-constraint` to improve the quality of the images. `Cyclegan` has a generator and a discriminator for each of the domains. The complete tutorial was covered in a previous post and can be found [here](https://shreyas-kowshik.github.io/blog/2019/05/23/community-bonding-period.html).

`Super-Resolution-GAN` is another cool application of GANs. It basically takes a downgraded version of a high-quality image and lears to map it back to the high resolution. It uses an interesting `Pixel-Shuffle` layer which permutes a feature map along channels and resizes it to obtain an upsampled version of the output. As this layer was not a part of `Flux`, it was used manually. The generator extracts the features from the low-resolution image and uses the pixel-shuffle operation to obtain the high-resolution output.

### Challenges faced

During the initial phase of training, the network was taking too long to train when compared with the pytorch and tensorflow counterparts. As discussed with my mentors, the suggested hack was to integrate [#335](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/pull/335) to the speedup. But due to time constraints and a plethora of work left to do, the problem was circumvented by making the networks smaller. The new networks are known to give decent results on other frameworks and so the reduction could be justified. The final status of training was that the models were overfitting in case of `pix2pix` and manually tuning hyperparameters was'nt that successful. So all in all the models have'nt been trained and tuning of hyper-parameters is still left.

### What has been achieved 
* Implemented the models and [PR](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/pull/157) sent
* `Pixel-Shuffle` layer [([#112]https://github.com/FluxML/NNlib.jl/pull/112)]

### What has'nt been achieved
* Training the models successfully

### Future Work
* Tune the hyper-parameters and try training on a small dataset first
* Experiment with architectures from stable implementations in other libraries and use the hyperparameters therein

## The Reinforcement Learning Baselines

As a part of my proposal, I had to implement `Trust Region Policy Optimization`, `Proximal Policy Optimization` and `Deep Recurrent Q-Networks`. This was the part that most appealed to me, because the consequences were two fold : 
* There were quite a few networks as a part of model zoo for computer-vision models, but not many diverse models in terms of reinforcement learning.
* RL has shifted focus to new state-of-the art models for policy gradients like `TRPO` and `PPO` and adding them would attract many people to do RL in julia.

Realising that a general API was required now for the policy gradient methods which `TRPO` and `PPO` heavily share, I decided to create the package along the lines of the `openai-baselines`. 

The code is maintained in the [this](https://github.com/shreyas-kowshik/RL-baselines.jl) repository. The code for the recurrent-q-network can be found in the `drqn` branch.

A PR regarding the same has been added [here](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/pull/158).

### A Peek Into The API

Before talking about the models, let's look at what the structure of the package is like. 

In general, with the type of environments available currently in `Gym.jl`, the action space can either be `Discrete` or `Continuous`. We define a `CategoricalPolicy` structure to handle the `Discrete` action spaces and `DiagonalGaussianPolicy` to handle `Continuous` action spaces. The functions for `entropy`, `kl-divergence`, etc. are a part of each policy and are defined in `policy.jl` in the `common/` directory. This is done to abstract out the policy definition to allow for easy extensibility of the code in future with newer environments and models. We also define a `Buffer` structure to log different variables and their values. For both `trpo` and `ppo` a file called `rollout.jl` handles all code for parallelly running agents, collecting trajectories of experiences and processing the trajectories to extract out all relevant information from them. The basic structure being covered, let us understand about the model implementations.

`TRPO` tries to solve the problem of policy updates by not letting the policy change by a large margin in each step and at the same time theoretically giving a garuntee on the improvement in the total expected return at each time step. It does this by solving the constrained optimization problem by making approximations to the contraint and a formulated surrogate loss function. The implementation involves using some nifty details like `Hessian-Vector-Product` computation and optimization using `Conjugate-Gradients`. It took quite a lot of time to digest these concepts and after reading throgh stable pieces of code and gluing it all up, the model was built in pure julia.

`PPO` sort of simplifies the objective of `TRPO` by allowing for violation of the `KL-Divergence` constraint, but giving a much simpler policy update. It is easier to code up and in practice does quite well in comparision fo `TRPO`. 

`Deep-Recurrent-Q-Networks` is an extension of the work done last year by <b>Tejan Karmali [ @tejank10 ]</b>. The idea was basically to add a `LSTM` layer in the Q-network to process timesteps of experience than just a single timestep. The advantage of these models is that they can hangle `Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes` as well.

### What has been achieved
* `PPO` and `TRPO` trained on `Pendulum-v0` and `CartPole-v0`. [<b>Note : </b>`TRPO` was'nt trained on `CartPole-v0` as nested AD is currently not supported for `softmax` which is used for this environment and in `TRPO`]
* A package along the lines of `openai-baselines` for the model-zoo

### What has'nt been achieved 
* Proper convergence of training on `Deep-Recurrent-Q-Networks`

### Future work
With the `Arcade Learning Environment` being setup, it would be good to try out the models on those environments and obtain a few benchmarks with `Flux`

# The Image Captioning Network
Coming to the final leg of my proposal, the idea was to impelement the paper [Show and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555). 

The idea is pretty straightforward. Given an image, we extract features using a pre-trained CNN like `VGG19` and cache them for efficiency. This is used as an input to a `LSTM` cell which further gets the subsequent caption words and learns to predict, sequence-wise, the next word in the caption. The training was done on the `MSCOCO` dataset. Overall, results were average, and can be found in the `Test.ipynb` jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/shreyas-kowshik/Image-Captioning.jl/blob/master/src/Test.ipynb).

### What has been achieved
* Model trained on `30000` captions of the `MSCOCO` dataset. Work is to be added to the model-zoo with the reference to [https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/pull/159](this PR).

### Future work
* Add attention to the captioning network
* Train the network on a greater number of captions

The code and the results are available here.

# Conclusion
Summarsing the past three months, it was indeed a great learning experience. I got to learn by implementing actual code and training complex RL-Agents from scratch, something I had never done before. It was filled with reading papers, some advanced math and trying to put it all into code. The community was equally helping and supportive at all times and I am really thankful to my mentors, fellow GSoC/JSoC students and the entire Julia community for providing me with an invaluable experience over the summer. I look forward to contribute to the community in the coming times and will do justice to my love for open-source.
