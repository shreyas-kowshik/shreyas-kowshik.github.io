<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t has been a long time since I have actually written this markdown in jekyll and have finally
created my first blog post on my own site.I only used to conceptualize it and never actually did the work to be done.This task was given as summer
work by The <a href="https://kossiitkgp.in/index.html" target="_blank">Kharagpur Open Source Society(KOSS)</a>.So finally here it is...
</p>

<p>
The first year summers started off to be very hectic for me.I was in multiple research groups and there was immense amount of work to be done,
especially in AGV.Typical days used to be occupied with reading tutorials,coding the tutorials and then testing.Much of the work we did required
frequent nightouts as we had to test the bot early in the morning at 5 when the sun would just be up and there would be no glare onto the camera.
</p>

<p>
I worked on modules of robot localization,path planning and computer vision for the AGV team.For those of you who find these words complicated,
let me explain it to you...
</p>

<p>
<b>Robot Localization</b> is the problem wherein we need to tell the robot or a car for that matter,where it is with respect to it's surroundings.
Many of you may ask that we can use a GPS for this task,so why write code for it? The question makes sense,but GPS has an error of around 10 meters... Considering the margin at stake,10 meters is enough to destroy any bot anyhow! We achieve this using the an algorithm called The
Extended Kalman Filter which uses data from sensors and makes an estimate on the bot's position and velocity.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Path Planning : </b> as obvious as it sounds, it is the problem of finding a feasible trajectory between two point for the bot to move.
	One also needs to generate the entire velocity profile for the bot,as in how fast it must move at each point in it's trajectory.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Computer Vision : </b> It is by far the most challenging field in autonomous driving.Here we have to use the camera feed and extract as much 
	information from it as possible.I worked on obstacle detection and segmentation,lane detection,lane navigation and lane fitting.
</p>

<p>
	The work at KRSSG generally involved writin tactics for the bots and working on algorithms to handle dynamic and highly stochastic environments 
	efficiently.I also worked on path planning of the bots.
</p>

<p>
	After having done a month of work,it was finally time to return home and get some much required peace.After a couple of weeks of meeting 
	friends and a family trip, I've completed this site finally and will in due course update it as well
