<!-- **Work**: Since October 2017, I have been working as a data scientist at [Nightingale Health]. Prior to that, I have worked as a data scientist at [Reaktor] (2014-2017), and as a researcher in Aalto Universty and its predecessor, the Helsinki University of Technology.

**Education**: I finished my PhD in the [Statistical Machine Learning and Bioinformatics][smlb] group at Aalto University in 2014. In my thesis I developed and applied probabilistic machine learning methods to biomedical applications. See more about my research in the [Projects][proj-research] page.

**Open knowledge**: On my spare time I have been creating open source tools for handling open data in the [Louhos][] and [rOpenGov][] projects. See more at the [Projects][proj-opentools] page.

**Hobbies**: Ultimate frisbee, freeskiing, kiteskiing, photography, cycling.
